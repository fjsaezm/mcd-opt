Optimization
---

Two sheets of exercises have been done. They can be found in the folder [Ejercicios]():

- Optimization problems solved using **linear programming** (Folder [PL]())
- **Convex optimization** problems solved using Lagrangian duality. Also, proof for some known propositions have been done by us (Folder [Convex]())

Furthermore, we implemented a few stochastic optimization algorithms which can be found in the folder [Practicas]()
