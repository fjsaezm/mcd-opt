Optimization
---

Two sheets of exercises have been done. They can be found in the folder [Ejercicios](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-opt/tree/main/Ejercicios):

- Optimization problems solved using **linear programming** (Folder [Ejercicios/PL](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-opt/tree/main/Ejercicios/PL))
- **Convex optimization** problems solved using Lagrangian duality. Also, proof for some known propositions have been done by us (Folder [Ejercicios/Convex](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-opt/tree/main/Ejercicios/Convex))

Furthermore, we implemented a few stochastic optimization algorithms which can be found in the folder [Practicas](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-opt/tree/main/Practicas)
